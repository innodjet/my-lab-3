   people using the SWAPI API (https://swapi.co/) - You can access the people endpoint at
   https://swapi.co/api/people - A user should be able to see a person's name,
   height, mass, and gender.

2. Add a people search to the SearchBar component.
   Every character typed should result in new search
   results.The input should be case insensitive and
   should trim whitespace.

3. Add a 'homeworld' button to the person card.
   - When a user clicks this button, the section
     on the right of the page titled 'Homeworld'
     should be populated with information about that
     person's homeworld.
   - The homeworld is an attribute on the people
     object where it provides the api url for that
     homeworld. Using that url, you should populate
     the homeworld section with the name, climate,
